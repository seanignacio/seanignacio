# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm <small>@seanignacio</small>
Iâ€™m interested in the world of front-end web development.
## I speak:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- React.js
> I spent over 10 years working as a Webmaster/Copy Editor for The Guam Daily Post â€” a daily print + digital publication. As webmaster, I managed the website design, functionality and asset flow through the BLOX Content Management System in partnership with TownNews. As copy editor, I vetted hard news and editorials, as well as sports, business and lifestyle stories, screening for style â€” a blend of colloquialism and the AP rulebook â€” spelling, consistency, syntax, objectivity, and grammar.
> 
> Now, I am looking to further develop my skills and experience working with front-end systems.
